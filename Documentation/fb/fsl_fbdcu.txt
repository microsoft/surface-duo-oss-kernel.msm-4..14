General
=========================
Supported platforms: S32V234

Usage:
The drivers (fsl_fb and fsl_dcu) can be built directly into the kernel or as 
modules. If compiled as modules the following files will result: fsl_fb.ko and 
fsl_dcu.ko.
First the DCU driver needs to be started (insmod fsl_dcu.ko) followed by the FB 
driver (insmod fsl_fb.ko). At this point at least a /dev/fb0 (fsl_fb.ko) and a 
/dev/dcu0 (fsl_dcu.ko) should be created.

=========================
 Driver architecture
=========================
The Display Controller Unit (DCU) module is a system master that fetches 
graphics stored in internal or external memory and displays them on a TFT LCD 
panel. A wide range of panel sizes is supported and the timing of the interface 
signals is highly configurable. Graphics are read directly from memory and then 
blended in real-time, which allows for dynamic content creation with minimal CPU 
intervention.

The diagram describes the fsl fb/dcu driver architecture. The FB driver 
(fsl_fb.ko) registers /dev/fbX devices while the DCU driver (fsl_dcu.ko) 
registers /dev/dcuX devices. The operations the FB and DCU provide are 
complementary.

=========================
 Module FB (fsl_fb.ko)
=========================
The FB module is responsible for the creation and management of Linux FB devices 
(/dev/fbX). The module must include linux/fb.h and implement routines defined in 
struct fb_ops. The structure fb_ops defines the following routines: 
fb_check_var,  fb_set_par,  fb_setcolreg,  fb_blank,  fb_pan_display,  
fb_fillrect,  fb_copyarea,  fb_imageblit, fb_ioctl, fb_open, fb_release. The FB 
module relies on the DCU module for low level access to hardware.
Upon start the FB driver will create X device files (/dev/fbX) each 
corresponding to a unique layer in the DCU hardware. The maximum number of 
device files created is thus limited by the maximum number of hardware layers in 
the DCU.  All FB operations are susceptible to hardware limitations. Example if 
the maximum number of blended layers is 6 when blending 10 layers (all 
superposed) 4 layers will be ignored.
List of available IOCTL commands: MFB_SET_LAYER - copy buffer from user space to 
kernel space (display)
MFB_GET_LAYER - copy buffer from kernel space to user space (screenshot)
MFB_GET_ALPHA - get alfa layer value
MFB_SET_ALPHA - set alfa layer value

=========================
 Module DCU (fsl_dcu.ko)
=========================
The DCU driver is responsible for interfacing with the hardware and providing 
(exporting) certain routines for the FB module. The top layer of the DCU (DCU 
Linux Layer) is solely responsible for acquiring resources through Linux kernel 
routines (e.g. mapping the register space), providing routines for the FB module 
and calling routines from the lower DCU layer. The lower DCU layer is based on 
an existing implementation of bare-metal DCU driver which operates on resources 
supplied by the upper DCU Linux Layer (e.g pointer to the mapped register 
space).

In order to communicate via IOCTL commands the register device file (e.g. 
/dev/dcu0) should be opened (get corresponding file descriptor) and the DCU API 
Linux specification should be followed. All commands described by the present 
API are of the form "ioctl(dcu_fd, DCU_API_COMMAND, &struct_ptr_api)" where 
DCU_API_COMMAND is a fixed number specified by the API and struct_ptr_api is a 
pointer to a specific structure as defined by the API. Failing to submit correct 
commands (e.g. different structures, invalid values) leads the driver to 
undefined behaviour/state.

List of available IOCTL commands: IOCTL_SET_LAYER_POS - Move layer to position 
(x, y) on screen
IOCTL_GET_LAYER_POS - Get layer position (x, y) on screen
IOCTL_SET_LAYER_ALPHA_VAL - Set the layer alfa transparency value
IOCTL_GET_LAYER_ALPHA_VAL - Get layer alfa transparency value
IOCTL_SET_LAYER_ALPHA_MODE - Set layer key alfa mode
IOCTL_GET_LAYER_ALPHA_MODE - Get layer key alfa mode
IOCTL_SET_LAYER_CHROMA_KEY - Set layer color keying chroma
IOCTL_GET_LAYER_CHROMA_KEY - Get layer color keying chroma
IOCTL_SET_DISPLAY_CFG - Set display DCU configuration (LVDS/HDMI + timmings)
IOCTL_PRINT_DISPLAY_INFO - Show EDID settings read by DCU driver from HDMI 
driver
