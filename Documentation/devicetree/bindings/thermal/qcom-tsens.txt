* QCOM SoC Temperature Sensor (TSENS)

Required properties:
- compatible :
 - "qcom,msm8916-tsens" : For 8916 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8974-tsens" : For 8974 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,apq8064-tsens" : For 8064 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8960-tsens" : For 8960 Family of SoCs

- reg: Address range of the thermal registers
- qcom,tsens-slopes : Must contain slope value for each of the sensors controlled
			by this device
- eeproms: List of phandles to the data cells containing calibration data in EEPROM
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description.

Optional properties:
- eeprom-names: List of eeprom data cell names stored in the same order as the
		eeprom property
- qcom,sensor-id: List of sensor instances used in a given SoC. A TSENS IP can
		  have a fixed number of sensors (like 11) but a given SoC can
		  use only 5 of these and they might not always the first 5. They
		  could be sensors 0, 1, 4, 8 and 9. This property is used to
		  describe the subset of the sensors used. If this property is
		  missing they are assumed to be the first 'n'
		  sensors numbered sequentially.

Exiample:
tsens: thermal-sesnor@900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8916-tsens";
		qcom,tsens-slopes = <1176 1176 1154 1176 1111
				1132 1132 1199 1132 1199
				1132>;
		eeproms = <&tsens_caldata>, <&tsens_calsel>;
		eeprom-names = "calib_data", "calib_sel";
		qcom,tsens-slopes = <3200 3200 3200 3200 3200>;
		qcom,sensor-id = <0 1 2 4 5>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};
