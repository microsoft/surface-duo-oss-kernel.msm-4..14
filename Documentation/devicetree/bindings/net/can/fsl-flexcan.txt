Flexcan CAN controller on Freescale's ARM and PowerPC system-on-a-chip (SOC).

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "fsl,<processor>-flexcan"

  An implementation should also claim any of the following compatibles
  that it is fully backwards compatible with:

  - fsl,p1010-flexcan
  - fsl,s32v234-flexcan
  - fsl,s32gen1-flexcan

- reg : Offset and length of the register set for this device
- interrupts : Interrupt tuple(s) for this device. If interrupt-names are
               missing, these should specify, in order:
               - for S32V234:
                 1. ERRINT | BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                 2. MB0-63 interrupts;
               - for S32GEN1:
                 1. BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                 2. ERRINT;
                 3. MB0-7 interrupts;
                 4. MB8-127 interrupts;
               - for all the other SoCs:
                 1. all interrupts combined.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency : The oscillator frequency driving the flexcan device

- xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver

- big-endian: This means the registers of FlexCAN controller are big endian.
              This is optional property.i.e. if this property is not present in
              device tree node then controller is assumed to be little endian.
              if this property is present then controller is assumed to be big
              endian.

- fsl,stop-mode: register bits of stop mode control, the format is
		 <&gpr req_gpr req_bit ack_gpr ack_bit>.
		 gpr is the phandle to general purpose register node.
		 req_gpr is the gpr register offset of CAN stop request.
		 req_bit is the bit offset of CAN stop request.
		 ack_gpr is the gpr register offset of CAN stop acknowledge.
		 ack_bit is the bit offset of CAN stop acknowledge.

- fsl,clk-source: Select the clock source to the CAN Protocol Engine (PE).
		  It's SoC Implementation dependent. Refer to RM for detailed
		  definition. If this property is not set in device tree node
		  then driver selects clock source 1 by default.
		  0: clock source 0 (oscillator clock)
		  1: clock source 1 (peripheral clock)

- wakeup-source: enable CAN remote wakeup

- interrupt-names: Allows the interrupt specifiers in "interrupts" to be stated
                   in any order, one for each name in here. Can contain:
                   "state" - BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                   "berr" - ERRINT;
                   "mb_0-7" - MB0-7 interrupts;
                   "mb_8-127" - MB8-127 interrupts;
                   "state-berr" - ERRINT | BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT |
                                  RWRNINT;
                   "mb" - all MB interrupts;
                   "all" - all interrupts combined.

- s32v234-ocotp: On S32V234 SoCs, phandle pointer to the On-Chip One Time
                 Programmable (OCOTP) node, if CAN FD support is desired on
                 compatible parts

Examples:

	can@1c000 {
		compatible = "fsl,p1010-flexcan";
		reg = <0x1c000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <48 0x2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
		clock-frequency = <200000000>; // filled in by bootloader
		fsl,clk-source = <0>; // select clock source 0 for PE
	};

	flexcan@40055000 {
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-flexcan";
		reg = <0x0 0x40055000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 41 4>,
			     <0 42 4>;
		interrupt-names = "state-berr", "mb";
		clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_CAN0>,
			 <&clks S32V234_CLK_CAN>;
		clock-names = "ipg", "per";
		s32v234-ocotp = <&ocotp>;
	};
