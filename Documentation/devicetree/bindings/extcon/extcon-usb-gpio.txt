USB GPIO Extcon device

This is a virtual device used to generate USB cable states from the USB
ID and VBUS signals connected to GPIO pins.

The extcon cable states USB and USB_HOST are actually VBUS and !ID
pin states and do not indicate what mode the USB needs to operate in.
That decision is done by the USB stack.

Some devices have only one of these GPIO pins, so we support cases when
only one of them is present. Hence properties 'id-gpio' and 'vbus-gpio'
are described as optional, but at least one of them has to be present
in extcon-usb-gpio node.

In general we have three cases:
1. If VBUS and ID gpios are present we pass them as is
	USB-HOST = !ID, USB = VBUS
2. If only VBUS gpio is present we assume that ID pin is always High.
	USB-HOST = false, USB = VBUS.
3. If only ID pin is available we infer the VBUS pin states based on ID.
	USB-HOST = !ID, USB = ID

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "linux,extcon-usb-gpio"

Optional properties
- id-gpio: gpio for USB ID pin. See gpio binding.
- vbus-gpio: gpio for USB VBUS pin. See gpio binding.
- debounce: gpio debounce time in milliseconds (u32).


Example: Examples of extcon-usb-gpio node in dra7-evm.dts as listed below:
 	extcon_usb1 {
 		compatible = "linux,extcon-usb-gpio";
 		id-gpio = <&gpio6 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		vbus-gpio = <&gpio6 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		debounce = <25>;
 	}

 	&omap_dwc3_1 {

		extcon = <&extcon_usb1>;
	};
